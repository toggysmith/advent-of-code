[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an Advent-calendar-themed series of programming challenges created by [Eric Wastl](http://was.tl/projects/).

This repository contains my solutions to the challenges. They're not intended to be the best, I'm primarily using Advent of Code to learn new languages.
